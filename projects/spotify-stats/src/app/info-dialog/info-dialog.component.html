<h2 mat-dialog-title>Retrieve data from Spotify</h2>

<div mat-dialog-content>
  Spotify keeps track of all your plays. Unfortunately it doesn't provide a decent way to
  retrieve this data programmatically so you'll have to request this data manually. You can
  do this on the <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/account/privacy/" target="_blank">spotify privacy page</a>.<br><br>

  <strong>Note:</strong> Default it will only provide streaming history for the <u>past year</u>.
  If you select Extended streaming history it includes <u>all</u> your streaming history!<br><br>

  After you received an email (takes about a week) you can download the zip and upload my_spotify_data.zip here.
